# Hi, I'm Nurmyrza 👋  
Welcome to my GitHub Profile! I'm a curiosity-driven CS & EE student @ KAIST | AI & Web Dev Enthusiast | Competitive Programming Medalist 🥇

⚠️ Note: My account may have some cobwebs 😅 - going to clear out my old high school repos that are junk.  
🌱 I’m currently learning new programming languages and frameworks so I will mostly be working on small projects focused on practicing what I am learning.

## 🔭 Currently Working On
- Coding small projects to apply what I’m learning about **FastAPI**.  
- Building more small projects to practice **Docker**.  
- Experimenting with ML algorithms and data visualization to sharpen my skills (practice makes perfect).  
- Exploring how to connect trained ML models to client-side functionality.
